Description
-----------

Diplomancer automatically changes your watched faction based on your
current zone and subzone. It supports over 80 zones and 120 subzones
from all continents and game expansions.

For example, while in Dalaran, you’ll watch the Kirin Tor. At the Argent
Tournament Grounds, you’ll watch The Sunreavers or The Silver Covenant,
depending on your race. Inside level 80 dungeons, if you are wearing a
faction champion tabard, you’ll watch that faction.

In places without an associated faction - for example, if you’re a troll
on a weekend camping trip in the lovely Redridge Mountains - you’ll
watch your race’s faction. You can also choose your own default faction
to watch instead of your race’s faction.

Diplomancer was inspired by Charnow’s SmartFactionWatch.
