Description

	Diplomancer is a World of Warcraft user interface addon to
	automatically change your watched faction based on your location.

	For example:
	- In Dalaran, you'll watch the Kirin Tor.
	- At the Argent Tournament Grounds, you'll watch The Sunreavers or
	  The Silver Covenant, depending on your race.
	- Inside level 80 dungeons, if you're wearing a faction champion
	  tabard, you'll watch that faction.

	Diplomancer includes faction associations for over 80 zones and over
	120 subzones, covering all continents and game expansions.
	
	If you find yourself in a location without an associated faction -
	for example, if you are a troll on a weekend camping trip in the
	Redridge Mountains - Diplomancer will watch your race's faction. If
	you would prefer to watch another faction instead of your race's
	faction, you can choose your own default faction.

	Options are available in the standard Interface Options window.
	Typing "/diplomancer" or "/dm" will open the window and jump
	directly to the Diplomancer panel.
