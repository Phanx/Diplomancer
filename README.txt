Diplomancer
===============

Proactively changes your watched faction based on your current location.

It differs from other faction-switching addons in that it changes your
watched faction as soon as you enter a particular area, instead of
waiting until you gain reputation with a faction. It includes faction
associations for all Classic, Burning Crusade, Wrath of the Lich King,
Cataclysm, and Mists of Pandaria content. It also recognizes faction
champion tabards inside appropriately-leveled dungeons.

While in locations without an associated faction — for example, if
you’re a troll taking a weekend camping trip in the lovely Redridge
Mountains — Diplomancer will watch your race’s faction. If you’d prefer
to watch another faction instead, you can choose your own default.

Credits
-----------

Diplomancer was inpsired by SmartFactionWatch, by Charnow. I liked the
idea, but not the implementation, and decided to write my own version
with cleaner code and support for many more zones and subzones.
