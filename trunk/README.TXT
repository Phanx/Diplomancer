Description

	Diplomancer automatically changes your watched faction based on your
	current zone and subzone. It supports over 80 zones and 120 subzones
	from all continents and game expansions.
	
	For example, while in Dalaran, you'll watch the Kirin Tor. At the
	Argent TournamentGrounds, you'll watch The Sunreavers or The Silver
	Covenant, depending on your race. Inside level 80 dungeons, if you
	are wearing a faction champion tabard, you'll watch that faction.

	In places without an associated faction - for example, if you're a
	troll on a weekend camping trip in the lovely Redridge Mountains -
	you'll watch your race's faction. You can also choose your own
	default faction to watch instead of your race's faction.

Usage

	Options are available in the Interface Options window. Type "/dm" or
	"/diplomancer" to open the window directly to the Diplomancer panel.
