Description
-----------

Diplomancer proactively changes your watched faction based on your
current location.

It differs from other faction-switching addons in that it changes your
watched faction as soon as you enter a particular area, instead of
waiting until you gain reputation with a faction. It includes faction
associations for all Classic, Burning Crusade, Wrath of the Lich King,
and Cataclysm content. It also recognizes faction champion tabards
inside appropriately-leveled dungeons.

While in locations without an associated faction — for example, if
you’re a troll taking a weekend camping trip in the lovely Redridge
Mountains — Diplomancer will watch your race’s faction. If you’d prefer
to watch another faction instead, you can choose your own default.

To add or update translations for Diplomancer, see the Localization tab
on the CurseForge project page:

To add or update translations for faction or subzone names, see the
LibBabble-Faction-3.0 and LibBabble-Subzone-3.0 project pages:
	http://wow.curseforge.com/addons/libbabble-faction-3-0/
	http://wow.curseforge.com/addons/libbabble-subzone-3-0/

Diplomancer depends on the faction and subzone names provided by these
libraries to work in non-English locales, so if either library does not
yet include translations for your locale, Diplomancer won’t work for
you yet either.

These libraries are not loaded while playing in English, so if you only
play in English and are concerned about disk space, you can safely
remove them from the Diplomancer/Libs folder. *Do not* remove the other
libraries, as they are required for the options window.

Diplomancer was inpsired by SmartFactionWatch, by Charnow. I liked the
idea, but not the implementation, and decided to write my own version
with cleaner code and support for many more zones and subzones.
